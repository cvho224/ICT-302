Hello, this page is going to be all about me. My name is Colton Howard and I am a senior at the University of Kentucky. My major is Information Communication Technology (ICT) while my minor is in Computer Science. I transfered from Big Sandy Community and Technical College with an associates degree in science in the hopes of becoming a Computer Engineer. After transfering, I soon figured out that I couldn't do calculus. Because I couldn't do calculus I decided ICT was going to be the next best thing for me.
