Hello, this page is going to be all about me.  My name is Colton Howard and I am a student at the University of Kentucky. I am an Information Communication Technology major with a minor in Computer Science. I started out at the college as an Engineering Major, but after having trouble in Calculus I decided that this was going to be the next best thing for me.
