Letâ€™s talk about what I learned this week. There was some key concepts we did learn this week in content management. This week we learned about what content management was and learned about what makes up a content management team. For comparing content management systems, I decided to look at Jira which is a software to manage projects. I wanted to compare it to Teams. It looks like it is also a software that provides Kanban boards. As far as managing content using workflows, I managed content by creating a workflow in teams to outline how we were going to start doing our group blog post. One technology related to content management is Microsoft planner. We used it in teams to create our Kanban. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. I decided to learn more about some other Kanban software and found Notion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app). As it turns out it is an app that provides databases, Kanban boards, wikis, and calendars. It also is a collaboration platform with markdown support, Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
