Week 6: The Start of Major Group work and moving away from Hugo
================================================================
I can be excited to say that this week we are finally moving away from learning about Hugo and going in to learning about WordPress. I am also very excited that we are starting group work this week as well. There weren’t really any key concepts we learned this week in content management. We mainly focused on learning about WordPress and didn’t discuss key concepts. For comparing content management systems, we compared Hugo to WordPress. Hugo is good, but it can be finicky. WordPress makes it a lot easier to make and share content. As far as managing content using workflows, me and my group worked on a [blog post]( https://sised.is.uky.edu/ict302wp/2020/09/26/monday-group-2-weekly-blog-post-1-what-is-a-cms/ "What is a CMS") explaining what a CMS (content management system) was. We met during class this week and later on Wednesday durning normal class time. we also have been talking with each other on Microsoft Teams. One technology related to content management is WordPress. We used it this week to make a blog post and share some content. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. WordPress uses HTML language with their posts, so I visited [w3schools]( https://www.w3schools.com/ "w3schools") to learn more about how to write simple things in HTML. I used it to learn how to add pictures, headers, and how to add bulleted lists this week. Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
