Wow, what a great start to a semester. I am looking forward to doing more cool stuff like this. I mean look, I have my own website! Anyway, lets talk about what I learned this week. There really isnt any key concepts we have learned this week as it is only the first week of classes and this week was used to get things set up. The same thing goes for comparing content management systems, we havent been introduced to any so I cant compare any. As far as managing content using workflows, We was able to manage content that was delivered to us by altering our notifications on the Teams apps. We could turn notifications on or off meaning we get content or we don't. One technology related to content management I can say this first week is a computer. I might not know now how to use it to content manage but hopefully I will very soon. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. This first week I wanted to know exactly what content management was, so I decided to look it up on wikipedia a link is provided here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management#:~:text=Content%20management%20(CM)%20is%20a,content%2C%20or%20simply%20as%20content.) Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
