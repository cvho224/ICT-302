Week 11: Content Aggregation and Extra Group Projects
=====================================================
I can be excited to say that this week we worked on our mid semester drafts for our final projects. We also got to submit feedback that could make the rest of the semester better. Enough about that, lets get into what all I learned this week. There were some key concepts we learned this week in content management. This week we learned about How to peer review papers. more specifically we look at the three steps to peer review effectively which are the following:
* Establish the Standard,
* Describe the Situation,
* and Provide Next Steps

For comparing content management systems, we didnt really compare any systems this week as we were mainly focused on our mid semester projects. As far as managing content using workflows, me and my group worked on a blog post exploring the importance of communication in times of a pandemic like COVID-19. We also made drafts of our final projects this week. We met during class this week, later on Wednesday during normal class time to talk about our blog post, and another time on Friday to discuss our mid semester assignments. We also have been talking with each other on Microsoft Teams. We didnt really explore any technologies related to content management systems this week as we were only focused on our mid semester assignments. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. This week I looked at GIPHY as part of one of our mid semester assignments. [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/ "GIPHY") is a website listing a lot of GIFs that you could use in different blog posts. I visited the site to get some GIFs for the assignments and looked at how to search them as well. Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
