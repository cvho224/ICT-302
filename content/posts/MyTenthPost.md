Week 10: Content Modeling
=========================
I can be excited to say that this week we Learned about content modeling and did peer review for some mid semeter assignments. Enough about that, lets get into what all I learned this week. There were some key concepts we learned this week in content management. This week we learned about content modeling and the attributes and datatypes associated with them. For comparing content management systems, we compared the content modeling of WordPress and Hugo. We did this in our explore activity this week. As far as managing content using workflows, me and my group worked on a blog post exploring different alternatives to Google. We met during class time this week to discuss the blog post and texted in Microsoft Teams later on Wednesday and throughout the rest of the week. We didnt really talk about a new technology related to content management this week. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. This week I looked at the different ways Hugo and Wordpress modeled their content and compared them. to learn more about how Hugo organizes its content I visited the Hugo help [page]( https://gohugo.io/content-management/""). It is a website that will let you know everything you need to know about Hugo. Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
