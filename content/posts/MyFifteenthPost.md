Week 15: End of Semester Check In And Final Blog Post
=====================================================
Unfortunately, this will be my final blog post. It has been a good semester and im glad for all of the different things I have learned by doing this blog for the past 15 weeks. For our final week of classes, we reviewed submitting peer feedback. Enough about that, lets get into what all I learned this week. There were some key concepts we learned this week in content management. This week we learned about and reviewed how to give effective peer reviews. For comparing content management systems, we didnt really compare any content management systems, we did however compare our final projects to the rubrics assigned to them. As far as managing content using workflows, me and my group worked on a blog post exploring Augmented Reality. We also met to explore Menus on the WordPress site. We mainly have been talking with each other on Microsoft Teams where we talked about our blog post and discussed the Menu we wanted to add to the WordPress site. One technology related to content management systems I learned about this week was menus in WordPress. I found this article in wpbeginner titled [How to Add Navigation Menu in WordPress (Beginner’s Guide)](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-navigation-menu-in-wordpress-beginners-guide/ "How to Add Navigation Menu in WordPress (Beginner’s Guide)") which taught me more about it. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. This week I wanted to learn more about how to give effective peer feedback. To do this, I found an article called the [12 Tips for Giving Peer-to-Peer Feedback](https://justworks.com/blog/dont-make-peer-to-peer-constructive-criticism-awkward "12 Tips for Giving Peer-to-Peer Feedback") where they talked more about it.  Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
