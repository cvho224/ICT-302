Week 4: The Week We Didn't Attend Usual Classes.
================================================
This week turned out to be different than the other ones as we didn’t meet during normal class time. Nevertheless, I still managed to learn a lot this week. There were some key concepts we did learn this week in content management. This week we learned about what a content management system is. We finally finished building our definition. According to Barker a content management system is “A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content.” For comparing content management systems, we didn’t really compare any systems, but we did compare the considerations for choosing a content management system. As far as managing content using workflows, we created a workflow on our Hugo website that outlined how we was going to do things for the rest of the semester. We created some different pages and got to see how our site might look in the end. One technology related to content management is Blogger. In the annotated reading assignment, it states that “Blogger made it easier to organize articles and present a chronological feed of one’s content.” Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. One thing I decided to look at more in depth was the Hugo website. I discovered that the site is a very helpful tool for troubleshooting problems. I also learned that it has many pre-built themes that we could apply to our site in the future. Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
