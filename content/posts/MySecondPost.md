lets talk about what I learned this week. There was some key concepts we did learn this week in content management. this week we learned about what content was and gave examples of content and non content. For comparing content management systems, I learned that this website is a content management system. I havent really learned about any other ones yet, so I can't compare the website to any others. As far as managing content using workflows, I managed content by adding some new content in the form of my introduction page to the website as well as add this new post. One technology related to content management is this website. Lastly, but not least, is resources for self-directed learning. I decided to visit the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) website to learn more about html and also [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to learn about Markdown. Well, that is some things I learned this week and I hope to learn a lot more soon.
